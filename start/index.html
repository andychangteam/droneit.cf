<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Drone IT! application was a future application created by Alfie Andrus. The purpose of this Drone IT! application was to deliver some real life object to others. You might think of it as "Delivery", but it could deliver it immediately without stepping out of your room.</p>
<p>The Drone IT! application was first released or mentioned in chapter 3 of the novel <i>Dream Invader</i>. This page's purpose is to make this as an easter egg for people who read the novel <i>Dream Invader</i>.</p>
